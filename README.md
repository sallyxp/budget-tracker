##Introduction
A PWA (Progressive Web Application) is the creation of a web application with Vanilla JavaScript that runs within the browser (just like a normal website).
However it can also harness the power of native device features, so that when it is installed on a mobile, this application can still be accessed offline 
and get push notifications.  PWAs are web apps that run in a browser but behave very much like a mobile app.

This is the link to the Heroku deployment:

This system has the following landing page:
![alt text](/ReadmeImages/LandingPage.png) 

## *Installation*
To run this webpage, click on the Heroku link above.

To run this application, the user must clone all the files from this repository.  They also need to have 3 sessions running:
1 - type 'Mongod' on the command line
2 - type 'Mongo' on the second session, then 'Use Workout" to open the database
3. In the third session, type 'node server.js' on the cmd line.

 ## Usage

 The user is first presented with the landing page above.  Transactions are added by completing 'Name of Transaction' with a description and an amount in 'Transaction amount'.  This amount will be either incremented or decremented from the running total (which is displayed at the top of the screen).  Beneath the transactions a graph displaying total balance against time is displayed and changes as new transactions are added.
