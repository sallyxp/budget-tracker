##Introduction
A PWA (Progressive Web Application) is the creation of a web application with Vanilla JavaScript that runs within the browser (just like a normal website).
However it can also harness the power of native device features, so that when it is installed on a mobile, this application can still be accessed offline 
and get push notifications.  PWAs are web apps that run in a browser but behave very much like a mobile app.

This is the link to the Heroku deployment:
